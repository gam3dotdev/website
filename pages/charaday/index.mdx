### What is it?
Charaday Worlds is an AI-based, roleplay-oriented app with an emphasis on rich characters and worldbuilding. Learn more about its [features](/charaday/features).

### Who is it for?
The app is geared toward more experienced users who enjoy complex character interactions and worldbuilding, are willing to try new features, and want to help shape the app's development.

### Is it free?
Yes, and it will always be free. No monthly subscriptions, no donations, no ads.

### What about privacy?
It runs 100% locally, does not use the cloud, and does not send any information anywhere.

### What do I need to run it on my computer?
The app runs natively on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The app itself does not have any AI, and you will need to use [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) as a backend. KoboldCPP can run locally or in the cloud, your choice.

### How do I start?
Charaday Worlds is community driven, kind of like a club. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/A47GfuJXU4), meet the community, and we'll get you started.

### What do you mean by 'community driven' and 'a club'?
It means that new features are proposed by community (club members), voted on and implemented by the developer.

### Who's behind Charaday Worlds?
It is developed by a single person. It's a hobby. So be patient.
